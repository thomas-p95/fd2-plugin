## Related Guidelines

This document focuses on Flutter-specific patterns. For complete guidance, also refer to:
- `@dart` - Dart language best practices, patterns, naming conventions
- `@state` - BLoC/Cubit patterns, state management, testing
- `@clean` - Layer separation, dependency injection, repositories
- `@test` - Testing strategies and patterns

## Key Principles

### Flutter-Specific Best Practices
1. **Use Widget Classes** - ALWAYS extract widgets into classes, NOT build methods
2. **Const Constructors** - Use const everywhere possible for performance
3. **Widget Composition** - Build widget trees with classes, not nested functions
4. **StatelessWidget First** - Prefer StatelessWidget, use StatefulWidget only for local UI state
5. **Small, Focused Widgets** - Keep each `.dart` widget file under 200 lines; split into separate files if exceeded

## Best Practices Summary

### DO
- Use Widget classes instead of build methods for ALL reusable components
- Use const constructors wherever possible
- Use StatelessWidget by default
- Use StatefulWidget ONLY for local UI state (animations, controllers)
- Use BLoC/Cubit for business logic (see `@state`)
- Use ListView.builder for long lists
- Use CachedNetworkImage for network images
- Use keys for list items
- Split large widgets into smaller, focused widget classes
- Keep each `.dart` widget file under 200 lines; split into separate files if exceeded
- Split complex `build` methods into separate widget classes; use private build methods only for simple (≤15 lines), no-param, single-use sections
- Organize widgets by feature
- Use UI kit components for consistent design

### DON'T
- Use build methods (_buildXxx) for reusable widgets with parameters
- Use StatefulWidget for business logic
- Create widgets in variables within build method
- Create deeply nested widget trees (>5 levels) without extraction
- Use ListView() constructor for long lists
- Skip keys in list items
- Ignore const optimization opportunities
- Hardcode strings (use localization)
- Write monolithic `build` methods — split complex sections into separate widget classes

### PREFER
- Widget classes over build methods (always!)
- Composition over complex widgets
- Small, focused widgets over large monolithic widgets
- Named parameters for all widget constructors
- Extracting to widget class if >5 lines or has parameters
- UI kit components over custom implementations

### AVOID
- Build methods with parameters
- Dart widget files larger than 200 lines — split instead
- Deep nesting without extraction
- Mixing business logic and UI
- Direct repository/service calls from widgets
- Ignoring performance best practices
